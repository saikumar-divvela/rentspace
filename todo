minor things
    add title to Post  10mins
    show start date to end date next to search bar  30mins

Delete post  ( don't delete post, just purge it in database)  1 hours


#upload a file   2Hrs
    Django provides File model object
    need to set two fields MEDIA field and MEDIA url in settings file: Django uses these fields to save and retrieve files
    usermodel 
        photo = models.ImageField(upload_to='cars')  # this is added to media root

    in view
    user.photo = request.FILES["file"]
    user.save()
    add this in url.py
    static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

if uploading multiple files
    in server code request.FILES.getlist("file_field")

# Add attributes   2Hrs
    display check boxes (predefined list)
    before sending response, convert checkbox values to json response (using jquery)
    show post
        show all selected check boxes
    update post
        show all checkboxes (predefined list) (using jquery)


# upload multiple files(post) (after uploading show the images in preview)  2Hrs

# show post (show picture with arrow marks)    2 hrs

# edit post (show pictures with remove option) 6 hrs

# Search post  6 hours

# api for login/logout   1Hr

to change upload behaviour, we can write custom file handler like progressBarUploadHandler

    request.upload_handlers.insert(0,ProgressBarUploadHandler(request)) -> progressBarUploadHandler is something written by us
    this has to be called before the POST request
