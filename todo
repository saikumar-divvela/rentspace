Delete post  ( don't delete post, just purge it in database)  1 hours

If uploading multiple files
    in server code request.FILES.getlist("file_field")
# Upload multiple files(post) (after uploading show the images in preview)  2Hrs
# Show post (show picture with arrow marks)    2 hrs
# Edit post (show pictures with remove option) 6 hrs
# Search post  6 hours

# Api for login/logout   1Hr

to change upload behaviour, we can write custom file handler like progressBarUploadHandler

    request.upload_handlers.insert(0,ProgressBarUploadHandler(request)) -> progressBarUploadHandler is something written by us
    this has to be called before the POST request
